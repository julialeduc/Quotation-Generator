# Project 5 from Openclassrooms Front End Developer Path
## Create a quotation generator
### Task: 
Build a random quotation generator. The quotes will be randomly constructed by assembling different pieces of a sentence.
### Technologies: 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
### Requirements: 
1. The quotes are generated randomly one by one with each JavaScript call
2. Each quote is a combination of at least 3 sentence fragments (beginning, middle, and end)
3. The quotes should be relatively coherent (no exclamation points in the middle of a sentence, for example)
4. Select the number of quotes generated (between 1 and 5)
5. Choose between 2 types of quote generators (accordingly, you'll need to different sets of sentences)
6. Once the quotes are generated, have the program generate new quotes or quit the program
